# Instructions:
# You get a new job working for Eggman Movers. Your first task is to write a
# method that will allow the admin staff to enter a personâ€™s name and return
# what that person's role is in the company.
# 
# You will be given an array of object literals holding the current employees
# of the company. You code must find the employee with the matching firstName
# and lastName and then return the role for that employee or if no employee is
# not found it should return "Does not work here!"
# 
# The array is preloaded and can be referenced using the variable employees.
# It uses the following structure.
# 
# employees = [ {first_name: "Dipper", last_name: "Pines", role: "Boss"}, ...... ]
# There are no duplicate names in the array and the name passed in will be a single
# string with a space between the first and last name i.e. Jane Doe
def find_employees_role(name):
    #your code here
    names = name.split()
    for employee in employees:
        if(employee['last_name'] == names[1] and employee['first_name'] == names[0]):
            return employee['role']
    return 'Does not work here!'
